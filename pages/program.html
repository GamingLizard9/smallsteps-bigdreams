            At Small Steps Big Dreams, we feel we  present a <strong>very well rounded environment</strong>
            that is <strong>rich in opportunities</strong> for  learning and creativity.   
            Through her studies and observations, Dr. Montessori truly believed that
            <em>no human being is educated by another  person.</em>  
            In reality, <strong>the child educates themself</strong>. 
            Each child has a <strong>natural desire to learn</strong>
             and being in a Montessori environment <strong>builds upon that desire</strong> which creates habits of lifelong learning.

            <p class="title">Practical Life</p>
            <p>
                The purpose of practical life lessons in the Montessori classroom is for a child 
                to develop specific abilities, such as confidence, coordination, cooperation, order and independence,
                 which are important factors to be successful.
                   These lessons include, care of self, care of the environment, and physical skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Care-of-self lessons include hand washing, preparing snack, folding clothes, 
                and learning how to button, zip, snap and tie.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Care-of-environment lessons include plant and animal care, and cleaning activities, 
                such as, sweeping, scrubbing, and polishing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Physical skills lessons include pouring, scooping, 
                spooning, tonging, tweezing, twisting, lacing, and squeezing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each activity and lesson given to the  child builds upon the last skill, 
                strengthening muscles in their hands and arms in preparation for writing.  
                As a child progresses throughout the year the lessons will reflect their stage of development, 
                and their age.  This area is the basis of all the other curriculum areas of the classroom, 
                and gives the  child the skills to be successful in all those areas in years to come and life.

              <p>          	
                The sensorial area helps children develop three skills used in math sequence; 
                learn discrimination between objects, classifications, and experience with a graded  series.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Learning discrimination between objects includes thickness, length, texture, and shape.  
                Some of the materials used are rods, cylinders, prisms and cubes.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Classifications is finding similarities such as matching activities.  
                Children find two items that are the same  within a set.  
                These activities include sound cylinders, fabric matching and color boxes.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Experience with a graded series are grading items from heavy to light, large to small, and thick to thin.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sensorial is a continuation, an  overlapping of ideas, thoughts, concepts and materials 
                    from the other curriculum  in the classroom.

                Math materials in the classroom give the child 'hands-on' experiences 
                in which the child can later visualize those experiences when they need to.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We begin with numeration activities that deal with the numbers 1-10.  
                This includes numerical rods, sandpaper numbers, sets basket, mystery number and tabletop rods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Linear counting uses colored beads.  This material includes the colored bead stair, 
                teens and tens boards and hanging bead stair.  These show children patterns in  math.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The decimal system introduces the child to place value through unit beads, ten bars, 
                hundred squares and thousand cubes.  The decimal cards and 45 layout exposes the child 
                to the quantities and symbols from 1-9000.  The child is introduced to equivalencies 
                and the concept of exchanging amounts.  These exercises lay the groundwork for the 
                four mathematical operations of addition, multiplication, subtraction and division.

                We begin with sandpaper  letters in which the child learns the sound and the symbol it represents.  
                Using several different activities, such as, object boxes and matching pictures to beginning 
                letter sounds, aides the child in learning each letter sound.  
                The movable alphabet is then added for beginning spelling activities.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The metal insets are introduced.  Children begin using these by tracing a frame, 
                this helps them gain control of the pencil.  Using the metal insets is one of the 
                first activities used to introduce writing.  This is when all the fine motor activities 
                of practical life and sensorial benefit the child by strengthening the hand and arm and 
                gaining coordination.  The salt tray is also used in beginning writing practice. This allows 
                the child to easily practice writing letters repeatedly.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Language lessons continue with middle sounds, ending sounds, rhyming and sight words.
